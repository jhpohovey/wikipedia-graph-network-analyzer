Week of November 16:
	This last week, we added our project goals, as well as our team contractin which we established the ground rules for this final project. We also started preliminary research into some aspects we are hoping to incorporate into our code, namely the graph visualization aspect, although this part is more so an extra addition we hope to add, as we already have all the requirements are already covered by our plans.

Week of November 30:
	This week we were able to develop the functions necessary for taking the data in the given format and converting it to an undirected graph. We also created some small scale tests to determine that the functions worked properly. To test our functions we had to create the makefile which allowed us to compile the code. On the algorithms side, we are almost done with our BFS implementation and it should be ready for testing soon.

Week of December 7:
	We have started working on both the Landmark algorithm and Dijkstra's Algorithm and hope to be working on writing test cases for these on this Monday.
