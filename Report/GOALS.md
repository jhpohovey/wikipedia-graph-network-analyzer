Goals for the Team will be as followed (goals are not immutable, and so this section may grow throughout the project):
We will be working with the Wikipedia hyperlink dependency data set, found here as part of the Stanford data series	
    Wikipedia networks, articles, and metadata - http://snap.stanford.edu/data/#wikipedia
We will be using Breadth-First-Search for our Traversal choice
Within the covered options category, we have chosen to develop the shortest path algorithm, probably using Dijkstra’s variant
Additionally, we will be working on developing a graphical output for our data
We’re also interested in the potential of finding a path between nodes through an intermediate node. This would be using the landmark path algorithm.
